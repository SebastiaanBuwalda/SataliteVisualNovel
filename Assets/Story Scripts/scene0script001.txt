<l>…</l>
<l>……</l>
<l>You feel weak.</l>
<l>Your head throbs. You feel like you've just been in a car crash.</l>
<l>Cold wraps around you.</l>
<s>???</s>
<l>Where… is this?</l>
<l>You force your eyes open.</l>
<l>A steel room. Featureless. Empty.</l>
<l>No windows. But it seems there's a single door.</l>
<l>White noise gnaws at you at the edge of hearing.</l>
<l>The bright light is artificial. A single, sterile LED lamp overhead.</l>
<s>You</s>
<l>Ugh…</l>
<l>What… happened to me?</l>
<s>???</s>
<l>You reach inward, searching for yourself.</l>
<l>But there’s nothing.</l>
<l>No name. No age. No gender. Not even a shape to the idea of “you.”</l>
<l>All that’s left are fragments.</l>
<l>knowledge without identity. Language. Physics. Math. Facts without a life to hold them.</l>
<s>???</s>
<l>Your gaze drifts down.</l>
<l>A body. If you can call it that. Wrapped head to toe in some mechanical shell. Cold metal where there should be skin.</l>
<l>The sight twists your gut.</l>
<l>Why?! Why am I like this?!</l>
<s>You</s>
<l>…Breathe! Calm down. Logical. Be logical.</l>
<l>But your breath quickens anyway. The air feels thinner. Your chest tightens.</l>
<s>???</s>
<l>You start searching for clues in the sterile steel room. If only to calm yourself.</l>
<l>You see it.</l>
<l>By the door sits a keypad.</l>
<l>It hums faintly, as if waiting.</l>
<l>On its screen… a puzzle? It seems you need to make 30.</l>
