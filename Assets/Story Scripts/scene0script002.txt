<l>[A cheerful trill rings out from the keypad. It sounds almost polite.]</l>
<l>Click.</l>
<l>The lock gives with a dry, mechanical sigh.</l>
<l>The door slides open. Beyond it, a narrow corridor stretches into shadow.</l>
<s>You</s>
<l>I did it!</l>
<l>It was Roman numerals. X is ten, and X as a multiplier. A double meaning.</l>
<l>But why would someone hide the exit behind a math trick?</l>
<l>Were they the same people who dressed me like this? The ones who erased my identity from my brain?</l>
<s>???</s>
<l>You step forward. Your boots clang against the metal floor. You feel anxious, but full of vigor.</l>
<l>The corridor is tighter then the room you woke up in.</l>
<l>The same sterile steel presses in on both sides. No windows. The hum of unseen machines vibrates through the soles of your feet.</l>
<l>But then...you startle. You see something in the distance.</l>
<l>At the far end, a figure waits. Metal plating. Segmented armor.</l>
<l>Like a mirror. This figure is identical to you.</l>
<l>They begin to run towards you! The suit makes the floor clank with each stride. For a moment your heart catches.</l>
<l>What do you do?</l>
